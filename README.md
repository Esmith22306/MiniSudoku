
# Overview

This project is a Mini 4x4 Sudoku game developed in C#. My goal with this project was to deepen my understanding of the C# language by building a complete, interactive console-based game that incorporates fundamental programming concepts.

The game allows players to select a difficulty level, fill in the Sudoku board using keyboard input, and receive feedback based on their progress. It includes features such as move validation, undo functionality, time tracking, and persistent game statistics.

I created this software to practice working with classes, structures, file I/O, string parsing, and control flow, while also reinforcing principles of user interaction and problem-solving in game logic.

# Future Work

- Update the whole thing to work for a 9x9.
- Add a notes feature for potential cells.
- Improve the puzzle generator to ensure a single unique solution every time. Also make sure the blanks dont ever make a puzzle unsolvable.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Windows Forms or WPF.
- Store difficulty-based high scores separately for better tracking.
